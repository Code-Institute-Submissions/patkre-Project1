                Cinik Tennis Club was formed in 1988 and has continuously provided the highest standard of playing facilities to the
                delight of its members. We love tennis and promote tennis for all ages and are always happy to welcome new and old
                players to our club. We are a social not-for-profit club and are run by our members for our members.

                We value enjoyment, fun, competition, fair play and promote a thriving safe and social environment where players can
                acheive their best competitively and personally. We have excellent coaches who run scheduled adult coaching and a
                comprehensive coaching programme for junior players.

                Lakewood Tennis Club is fully compliant with Tennis Irelands Child Protection policy and all legal statutory
                obligations. We take protecting the welfare and security of all members extremely seriously.

                When we run with others, we can run farther and faster more easily.
                Social running can pull you out of a running funk or low mood,
                inspire you to try new events.

                Running strengthens your heart by pumping blood more effectively
                through your body.
